About Me:

    Hi there! Iâ€™m a first year grad student in OHSU and major in Biomedical engineering. I am quite interested in exploring science and images data processing & visualization! I am passionate about creating fancy figure to draw attention from user/audience. In the future, I will keep working on learning, researching, and exploring science and technique.
